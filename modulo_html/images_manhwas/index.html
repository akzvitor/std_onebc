        <h3>Na Honjaman Level Up</h3>
        <p>
            In a world where awakened beings called “Hunters” must battle deadly monsters to protect humanity, Sung Jinwoo,
            nicknamed “the weakest hunter of all mankind,” finds himself in a constant struggle for survival. One day, after a brutal encounter 
            in an overpowered dungeon wipes out his party and threatens to end his life, a mysterious System chooses him as its sole player: 
            Jinwoo has been granted the rare opportunity to level up his abilities, possibly beyond any known limits. Follow Jinwoo’s journey 
            as he takes on ever-stronger enemies, both human and monster, to discover the secrets deep within the dungeons and the ultimate extent
            of his powers.

        <h3>Myeolmang Ihuui Segye</h3>
        <p>
            Synopsis: Faced with imminent defeat and certain death, would you choose to run – or continue to fight for a doomed world? When mysterious towers
             appear across the world, summoning monsters that prey on mankind, this is the choice presented to the Tower Walkers – adventurers with 
             special powers to fight the monsters. On the brink of death, they can choose to use a “regression stone” to return to the past for a second 
             chance, though this decision places them in a separate timeline forever. Stubborn Tower Walker Jae-Hwan rejects this choice, choosing to fight
             for the original timeline, and learning shocking secrets about the Tower along the way.

            off her medical bills, he braved a dangerous job as bait used by powerful superhumans called Awakeners to hunt monsters. But when 
            he found himself at death’s door, the image of his past life flashes through his mind. There, he found his truth: he is the 
            reincarnation of the Sorcerer King!
