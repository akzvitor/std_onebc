                and the ultimate extent
                of his powers.

                Synopsis: Faced with imminent defeat and certain death, would you choose to run – or continue to fight
                for a
                doomed world? When mysterious towers
                appear across the world, summoning monsters that prey on mankind, this is the choice presented to the
                Tower
                Walkers – adventurers with
                special powers to fight the monsters. On the brink of death, they can choose to use a “regression stone”
                to
                return to the past for a second
                chance, though this decision places them in a separate timeline forever. Stubborn Tower Walker Jae-Hwan
                rejects
                this choice, choosing to fight
                for the original timeline, and learning shocking secrets about the Tower along the way.

                Synopsis: Lucas Trowman was the greatest archmage in history until he was condemned by Demigod to spend
                eternity
                losing his mind.
                But 4,000 years later, he’s thrust back into this world, into the body of Frei Blake, the weakest, most
                un-talented student at
                the prestigious Westroad Academy for mages. After all this time, the world of magic has barely
                progressed. Could
                this be the
                work of Demigod? Determined to find out, Lucas seeks to reach the highest levels of power once again and
                get his
                revenge.

                Sung-Hoon Lee is nothing but a victim of a changing world, a powerless man in a land infested with
                beasts and
                magic. Monsters from
                another world invaded earth, and they brought with them a sickness that pushes Sung-Hoon’s mother into
                an
                endless sleep. To pay
                off her medical bills, he braved a dangerous job as bait used by powerful superhumans called Awakeners
                to hunt
                monsters. But when
                he found himself at death’s door, the image of his past life flashes through his mind. There, he found
                his
                truth: he is the
                reincarnation of the Sorcerer King!

                Kang Jin-Hyeok, a gaming streamer, and content creator is the only person who has cleared the game,
                [Tower of
                Trials]. However, as the game’s popularity declines, it becomes increasingly difficult for him to
                continue
                making a living as a content creator. Jinhyeok prepares to end his 11-year-long relationship with the
                game and
                say goodbye to his humble group of subscribers. But on that very day, the Tower of Trials appears in
                reality
                with a message saying that humanity will perish unless all players clear each floor within 90 days.
                Jin-Hyeok,
                who knows the game better than anyone, decides to use his knowledge to his advantage and dominate the
                tower.
                It’s time to show everyone what a hardcore gamer can do!
